            <h5>Larry Krystkowiak</h5>

            <div class="profile_comment">
                Head Basketball Coach
                <br>
                University of Utah
            </div>
            <div class="honoree_information">
                &emsp;&emsp; Larry Krystkowiak is entering his fifth year as the head coach of the Runnin’ Utes. Krystkowiak, 50, led
                the Utes to a 26-9 record, a berth in the Sweet 16 and a No. 15 final national ranking during the
                2014-15 season. Utah was ranked in the top 25 for 19 weeks–its most time spent in the national polls
                since the Final Four campaign of 1997-98. Utah also had its best finish since joining the Pac-12,
                placing third with a 13-5 conference mark and reaching the semifinals of the Pac-12 Tournament for the
                second time in three years. The Utes defeated Stephen F. Austin and Georgetown in the NCAA Tournament
                before losing to eventual national champion Duke in the Sweet 16, 63-57. The resurgence of Utah
                basketball under Krystkowiak has also ignited Utah’s fan base. The Utes averaged more than 12,000 fans
                to its home games this season, its highest attendance average since 2000-01. Individually, Delon Wright
                won the Bob Cousy Award and was a Wooden All-American selection under Krystkowiak. The senior guard was
                also named a second team All-American by the USBWA and the NABC. Wright, along with junior guard Brandon
                Taylor and freshman center Jakob Poeltl, garnered Pac-12 postseason honors. The Utes have also excelled
                in the classroom with Taylor being named a CoSIDA Academic All-District honoree and recently garnered
                Pac-12 All-Academic honors for a second year along with junior center Jeremy Olsen. Senior Austin
                Eastman and sophomore Kenneth Ogbe were also honored, giving Utah four student-athletes on the squad
                this season and a total of nine over the past two years, both tops in the conference. Striving for
                success, both on and off the court, are trademarks of the Krystkowiak era and due to improvements in
                both areas, the Utah head coach was rewarded with a five-year contract extension that runs through the
                2023-24 season. In 2013-14 Krystkowiak guided the Utes to their first postseason appearance since 2009
                and surpassed the 20-win mark. Wright, in his first season under Krystkowiak’s tutelage, went on to earn
                First Team All-Pac-12 and All-Defensive Team honors, a precedent for Utah men’s basketball in the
                conference of champions. Jordan Loveridge continued his development and finished among the top-12 in the
                league in scoring and rebounding and was Utah’s first Pac-12 Player of the Week. In 2012-13, Krystkowiak
                led Utah to the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals for the first time in program history and won two
                postseason games for the first time since winning the Mountain West Conference championship in 2009. The
                Utes also more than doubled their win total from the previous season by winning 15 games. Jason Washburn
                was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 becoming the first Ute to receive any postseason recognition
                since the team had entered the league. Also, Olsen was named to the Pac-12′s All-Academic First Team and
                became the first Ute to win scholastic honors since the switch in conferences. Krystkowiak was
                introduced on April 4, 2011 as the new men’s basketball coach at the University of Utah and the man to
                lead the Runnin’ Utes into the next phase of their storied history. Krystkowiak, who has prior head
                coaching experience in the NCAA, CBA and NBA, left a position as an assistant coach with the New Jersey
                Nets to become the 15th head coach in Utah men’s basketball history. In his previous collegiate head
                coaching post, Krystkowiak led his alma mater, the University of Montana, to a 42-20 record and two NCAA
                appearances as the Grizzlies’ coach from 2004-06 before joining the NBA coaching ranks. Hired as an
                assistant coach by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2006-07, “Krysko” was elevated to head coach with 17 games
                remaining in the season. He was retained as the Bucks’ head coach in 2007-08. Among the players he
                coached was former Ute All-American Andrew Bogut. Krystkowiak’s other head coaching experience was in
                the CBA with the Idaho Stampede in 2003-04. After a nine-year NBA playing career in six cities,
                Krystkowiak’s first coaching job was as an assistant coach at Montana from 1998-2000. The Grizzlies were
                the Big Sky champions in 2000. He then moved on to Old Dominion as an assistant in 2001-02 before
                signing on as the head coach of the CBA’s Idaho Stampede. In his lone season with the Stampede in
                2003-04, he led the team to a 38-14 record and a berth in the CBA Finals. Krystkowiak spent the next two
                seasons as the head coach at Montana. The Grizzlies were Big Sky champions in 2004-05, winning the
                conference tournament and earning an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. They appeared in the Big
                Dance in 2006 as well, earning an at-large bid and advancing to the second round with an upset victory
                over the fifth-seed Nevada. It was UM’s first NCAA tournament win since 1975. Montana finished the
                season with a 24-7 record, after going 18-13 in Krystkowiak’s first season, losing to No. 1 seed
                Washington in the NCAA First Round. The only three-time Big Sky MVP in league history and two-time
                Academic All-American for Montana from 1982-86, Krystkowiak is still the school’s all-time career leader
                in points (2,017) and rebounds (1,105). He was selected in the second round (28th overall pick) of the
                1986 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls and played in the league for nine years with San Antonio (1986-87),
                Milwaukee (1988-92), Utah (1992-93), Orlando (1993-94), Chicago (1994-96) and the Los Angeles Lakers
                (1996). Over his NBA career, he averaged 8.1 points and 4.1 rebounds a game with his best season in
                1988-89 when he averaged 12.7 points and 7.6 rebounds a game for Milwaukee. Krystkowiak made the Dean’s
                List four times at Montana, including in 1996, when he completed the degree he began over a decade
                earlier in business administration. He graduated with honors, boasting a 3.5 grade point average.
                Krystkowiak and his wife Jan have five children, sons Cam, Luc, Ben and twin daughters Samantha and
                Finley.
